# Gojob Scraper

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


Gojob Scraper is a simple web scraping tool built with Go. The primary goal of this project is to collect job listings from Remote Rocketship, extracting useful information like job title, company name, location, and job URL.

Why I Built This
I created this scraper as a way to practice working with Go while also exploring how to gather job data efficiently from public job boards. As I continue learning Go, I wanted to apply my skills to a real-world use case that demonstrates my understanding of HTTP requests, data parsing, and string manipulation.

What This Project Does
The scraper works by sending HTTP requests to a remote job board and extracting relevant job details from the page. It then displays the information in a structured format, showing the following fields:

Job Title

Company Name

Location

Job URL

Source


# Why It's Useful
Although the primary purpose was to improve my skills in Go, this scraper can also be a practical tool for anyone looking to quickly gather and view remote job opportunities from the site. Itâ€™s a lightweight and efficient way to automate job searching or data collection.


## How to Run




To run the scraper locally, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. Then, simply execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
go run main.go
The script will print out a list of job listings, including their titles, company names, locations, and URLs.

## Next Steps

I plan to expand this project by:

- Adding more job boards to scrape.
- Storing the results in a database or file.
- Implementing filters for job titles or locations.
- Scheduling automated scrapes using cron jobs.

Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
